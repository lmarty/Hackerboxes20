Projects for the Hackerboxes #20 badge hardware

## What is this?
This is a collection of projects for the [Hackerboxes](http://hackerboxes.com) Kit \#20 badge hardware.  The kit consists of an esp32 based "Dev Kit C" board, a nifty QVGA Color TFT LCD Display, a buzzer, 5 LEDs, 5 touch inputs and an SD_card slot.  For more information on the hardware platform, please see their [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/HackerBoxes-0020-Summer-Camp/)

The projects rely on the espressif esp32 Arduino libraries located [HERE.](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)
